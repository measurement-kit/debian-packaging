# Running tests through Valgrind by abusing of the LOG_COMPILER feature
# which is enabled by automake < 1.14 only when parallel tests are forced,
# so you now see why they are enabled explicitly in configure.ac
#
# See http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/233
#
# (Yes, of course this means valgrind runs in parallel -- i.e. faster.)
#
# On travis-ci we need on specific suppression for a memory warning that I
# honestly don't understand but that doesn't appear when building using docker
# on circle-ci and gitlab (BTW docker on travis using valgrind was odd since
# there were tons of errors unlike seen on every other docker and so I decided
# it was wiser avoding docker on travis). On other platforms (including my
# own docker on VoidLinux) no suppression file is needed.
