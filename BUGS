1. As find out in commit 08c5d97550527, the python generator gen_python should 
   implement the get_foo() methods in a different way. In fact, if the object to
   return has been passed to the constructor as a parameter, they should return
   this object, instead of calling the wrapper function. [FIXED]

2. The Connection module, when receiving the EOF, closes the connection, even if
   there is still something to write.
