# DESCRIPTION

The `Reactor` abstract interface dispatches I/O events. Most MeasurementKit
objects refer to a specific `Reactor` object.

The `make()` and `global()` factories return a reactor allocated
on the heap whose lifecycle is manager using a `Var<>` smart pointer.
Specifically, `make()` allocates a new reactor and `global()` returns
a reference to the global reactor.

The `call_later()` method schedules the callback `callback` to be executed
after `delay` seconds. Use the closure of the lambda to pass objects to the
callback (and make sure that the lifecycle is managed correctly):

```C++
    Var<Object> obj(new Object);
    reactor->call_later(1.22, [=]() {
        // Here we have used `=` to pass all objects accessible on the
        // stack by value to the lambda. This pattern should be safe as
        // long as either copying the objects makes sense or you pass
        // around objects managed through a Var<> smart pointer.
        // Note, however, that the compiler will only copy objects that
        // you are using inside the lambda, for efficiency.
        obj->something();
    });
```

The `call_soon()` method is just syntactic sugar for `call_later()` with
`0.0` passed as the first argument.

The blocking `loop()` method would run the event loop until the `break_loop()`
method is called. Calling `break_loop()` before `loop()` has no effect, in
the sense that the event loop would not be interrupted when entered. In fact,
this is a typical error (at least, it has been for me) leading to a program
that does not terminate. To avoid this, use `loop_with_initial_event()`:

```C++
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    Reactor reactor = Reactor::make();

    // Allocate objects on the stack before calling the blocking
    // `loop_with_initial_event` method of `reactor`.
    Object ob{reactor};
    Foo bar;

    // Capture by reference (`&`) because this method is blocking
    reactor->loop_with_initial_event([&]() {
        obj.action([&]() {
            bar.baz();
            reactor->break_loop();
        });
    });
}
```

This method basically starts the event loop and ensures that the callback
provided as its only argument is invoked just after the loop is started. This
way, there is the guarantee that, even if `break_loop()` is called
immediately because `action()` completes immediately, `break_loop()`
always occurs *after* starting the loop and hence the loop is always interrupted.

In `common/reactor.hpp` also define functions that have equal semantic to
`Reactor` methods but by default operate on the global reactor. For all these
functions, it is however possible to pass a custom reactor as the last
argument.

The `loop_with_initial_event_and_connectivity()` is a function that
only starts the event loop and calls the initial function when there
is connectivity. This is used typically in tests to avoid running
tests requiring the network when the network is not available. For
example,

```C++
TEST_CASE("We can GET a specific URL") {
    loop_with_initial_event_and_connectivity([]() {
        /* We enter here only if we have working connectivity. Without this check for
           connectivity, the test would fail, not because of an error in the code rather
           because connectivity is missing. */
        http::get("http://www.example.com", [](Error e, Var<http::Response>) {
            REQUIRE(!e);
            break_loop();
        });
    });
}
```

# HISTORY

The `Poller` class appeared in MeasurementKit 0.1.0. It was renamed
`Reactor` in MeasurementKit 0.2.0. As of MK v0.2.0, the `Poller`
still exists as a specific implementation of the `Reactor` interface
described in this manual page.
