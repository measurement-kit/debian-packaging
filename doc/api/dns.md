# DESCRIPTION

The `query()` function allows you to send DNS queries
and receive the corresponding responses.

The `dns_class` argument indicates the query class. At least
the following query classes are defined:

- *QueryClassId::IN*: this class represents the "internet" domain

Note that you can also pass the query class as string; e.g.,
the following would compile and run as expected:

```C++
    mk::dns::query("IN", ...);
```

The `dns_type` argument indicates the query type. The following
query types are defined:

- *QueryTypeId::A*: the `query_name` argument must be a domain name and the result
  would be the corresponding IPv4 address, if any.

- *QueryTypeId::AAAA*: the `query_name` argument must be a domain name and the result
  would be the corresponding IPv6 address. if any.

- *QueryTypeId::PTR*: the `query_name` argument should be an IP address expressed
  using the reverse `IN-ADDR` representation and the result would the corresponding
  domain name, if any (see `EXAMPLES` section for examples).

- *QueryTypeId::REVERSE_A*: the `query_name` argument should be an IPv4 address and the
  result would be the corresponding domain name, if any. This is a nonstandard
  DNS query type and basically instructs the DNS library to create for you
  the reverse `IN-ADDR` representation of the `query_name` field and issue a `PTR`
  query.

- *QueryTypeId::REVERSE_AAAA*: same as `REVERSE_A` except that here the input shall be
  a IPv6 address.

Note that you can also pass the query type as string; e.g. the following
would also work as expected:

```C++
    mk::dns::query("IN", "A", "www.google.com", ...);
```

The `callback` argument is a lambda to be called when the DNS response is available
or an error occurs. In case of success, error would be equal to `NoError()`. Otherwise,
the error that occurred is reported. Among all the possible errors, the following are
defined by MeasurementKit DNS implementation:

- `FormatError`: invalid response format
- `ServerFailedError`:  server failure
- `NotExistError`:  the name does not exist
- `NotImplementedError`:  query not implemented
- `RefusedError`:  the server refuses to reply
- `TruncatedError`:  response truncated
- `UknownError`:  internal evnds error
- `TimeoutError`:  query timed out
- `ShutdownError`:  evdns library was shut down
- `CancelError`:  user cancelled query
- `NoDataError`:  no data in the response

In case of success, the `Message` argument passed to the callback would
contain details on the response. The `Message` structure contains at least
the following fields:

```C++
class Message {
  public:
    double rtt = 0.0;
    std::vector<Query> queries;
    std::vector<Answer> answers;
};
```

where `rtt` is the time elapsed since issuing the query until receiving
the response; `queries` is the list of queries issued; `answers` is the list
of answers received.

The `Query` class contains at least the following fields:

```C++
class Query {
  public:
    QueryType type;
    QueryClass qclass;
    uint32_t ttl = 0;
    std::string name;
};
```

where `type` is the type of the query, `qclass` is the class of the
query, `ttl` is the time to live, and `name` is the name for which the
query was issued.

The `Answer` class contains at least the following fields:

```C++
class Answer {
  public:
    QueryType type;
    QueryClass qclass;
    uint32_t ttl = 0;
    std::string ipv4;             // For A records
    std::string ipv6;             // For AAAA records
    std::string hostname;         // For PTR, SOA and CNAME records
    std::string responsible_name; // For SOA records
    uint32_t serial_number;       // For SOA records
    uint32_t refresh_interval;    // For SOA records
    uint32_t retry_interval;      // For SOA records
    uint32_t minimum_ttl;         // For SOA records
    uint32_t expiration_limit;    // For SOA records
};
```

where `type` and `qclass` represent respectively the query type and the
query class, `ttl` is the response time to live, and the following fields
are only set for specific query types.

The optional `Settings` argument contains settings modifying the behavior of
the `query` function. The following setting keys are available:

- *"dns/attempts"*: how many attempts before erroring out (default is three)

- *"dns/nameserver"*: address of the name server to use. If you
  don't specify this, the default name server is used. On Unix systems the default DNS
  server is obtained parsing `/etc/resolv.conf`; on mobile devices where such file
  is not available, the default DNS name server is `127.0.0.1` which typically is not
  correct. Hence with mobile devices you SHOULD typically supply the DNS server
  you would like to use.

- *"dns/port"*: port of the name server to use. If you don't specify this, the
  default is `53`.

- *"dns/randomize_case"*: whether to [randomize request case to make DNS
  poisoning more complex](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2008-October/026025.html)
  (by default this is not done)

- *"dns/timeout"*: time after which we stop waiting for a response (by
  default this is five seconds)

The optional `reactor` argument is the reactor to use to issue the query
and receive the corresponding response.

# EXAMPLE

```C++
#include <measurement_kit/dns.hpp>

using namespace mk;

Settings settings({
    {"dns/nameserver", "8.8.8.8"},
    {"dns/port", 53},
    {"dns/attempts", 1},
    {"dns/timeout", 3.1415},
    {"dns/randomize_case", true},
});

dns::query(
        "IN", "AAAA", "nexa.polito.it",
        [](Error error, dns::Message message) {
            if (error) {
                throw error;
            }
            double rtt = message.rtt;
            for (auto answer : message.answers) {
                int ttl = answer.ttl;
                std::string r;
                if (answer.type == "A") {
                    r = answer.ipv4;
                } else if (answer.type == "AAAA") {
                    r = answer.ipv6;
                } else if (answer.type == "PTR") {
                    r = answer.hostname;
                } else {
                    continue;
                }
                /* ... */
            }
        }, settings);
```
