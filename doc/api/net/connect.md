# DESCRIPTION

The `connect()` function creates a connection to the remote `address` (which
typically is a FQDN) and `port` and calls `callback` when done. On failure,
an error is passed to the callback as its first argument; on success, the first
callback argument is `NoError` and the second argument is a `Transport` instance
wrapped by a `Var<>` smart pointer. Optionally you can also specify `settings`,
a specific `logger` and a specific `reactor`.

If `address` is a FQDN, this implementation of `connect()` will try all the
addresses obtained by resolving `address` before declaring the connect attempt
failed. In doing that, `connect()` would give preference to IPv4 addresses over
IPv6 addresses. Conversely, if `address` is already an IPv4 or IPv6 address, this
function would not attempt to resolve it and would try to connect it directly.

The behavior of `connect()` and of `Transport` s created using `connect()` can be
modified using the following `settings`:

- *"net/ca_bundle_path"* (string): path of the CA bundle to be used to verify
  SSL certificates. The default value is selected by `./configure` inspecting
  the local system when compiling. If the path is the empty string and we
  link against libressl (as is typically the case for mobile devices) we load
  libressl default CA from memory (i.e. you don't need anymore to include a
  CA file when setting up an application using measurement-kit).

- *"net/dumb_transport"*: if this key is present a dumb transport is created (i.e. a
  transport that is not connected to any socket).

- *"net/socks5_proxy"* (string): address and port (separated by colon) of the SOCKS5
  proxy to be used for establishing the requested connection (this feature is
  still experimental as of v0.2.0).

- *"net/ssl"* (bool): whether to establish a SSL connection (default: false).

- *"net/timeout"* (double): timeout for connect and I/O operations (default: `5.0` seconds).

To provide insights into what went wrong and what went right during the connect
attempt, the `Error` returned by `connect()` contains as `context` an instance of the
following class

```C++
struct ConnectResult : public ErrorContext {
    ResolveHostnameResult resolve_result;
    std::vector<Error> connect_result;
    bufferevent *connected_bev = nullptr;
};
```

where `resolve_result` contains the result of resolving the `address` argument into
an IP address, `connect_result` is a vector containing an error for each failed connect
attempt (where the size of the vector would be greater than one when a domain name
mapped to multiple addresses and connecting to more than one address failed), `connected_bev`
is the underlying libevent's `bufferevent` wrapped by `Transport`.

The `ResolveHostnameResult` class is like:

```C++
struct ResolveHostnameResult {
    bool inet_pton_ipv4 = false;
    bool inet_pton_ipv6 = false;
    Error ipv4_err;
    dns::Message ipv4_reply;
    Error ipv6_err;
    dns::Message ipv6_reply;
    std::vector<std::string> addresses;
};
```

where `inet_pton_ipv4` is `true` if `address` is an IPv4 address and similarly
`inet_pton_ipv6` is `true` if `address` is an IPv6 address; `ipv4_err` and `ipv4_reply`
are the values returned by resolving `address` as a FQDN into a list of addresses;
`ipv6_err` and `ipv6_reply` have the same semantic of their IPv4 counterparts; `addresses`
is the list of the addresses that `connect()` will try to connect to. This list will
only contain a IPv4 (or IPv6) address if `address` is an IPv4 (or IPv6) address and it
will contain IPv4 addresses before IPv6 addresses (if any) when `address` instead is
a FQDN (fully qualified domain name).

The `connect_many()` function is similar to `connect()`. The main different is
that `num` parallel connections are established and passed to the callback on success. Of
course, this function would return `NoError()` only if all the parallel connect attempts
were successful, and it would close all the open connections if only some connect attempts
were successful.

# BUGS

As of MeasurementKit v0.4, `connect()` does not implement SSLv2 and SSLv3,
therefore secure connection will fail with sites that use such deprecated
versions of the protocol.

# HISTORY

The `connect` submodule appeared in MeasurementKit 0.2.0.
