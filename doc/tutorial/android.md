# Android Tutorial

Measurement Kit is written in C++. Android applications are written
in Java. For an Android application to use Measurement Kit, there is
need to write JNI (Java Native Interface) code.

We already wrote JNI code for Measurement Kit. This code is hosted by
the [measurement-kit-android](
https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit-android) GitHub
repository.

If your objective is to develop Android applications based on Measurement
Kit, you are really looking for that repository. It also contains a tutorial
explaining how to integrate Measurement Kit into your Android app.

This tutorial, instead, explains how you could write your own JNI
code based on Measurement Kit cross compiled for Android.

To understand this, you first need to understand how to cross compile
Measurement Kit for Android. Then, you need to understand how to write
your own JNI wrappers for Measurement Kit API.
