Welcome to Measurement Kit **v0.6.0-beta** documentation!

# How to generate documentation

We use [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate HTML documentation
from markdown files. To regenerate documentation, you need to have a
recent version of Python installed. Specifically, the following commands
shows how you can generate the HTML files from the markdown. You must
run them from the toplevel directory (i.e. the one that contains the
`AUTHORS` file):

```
virtualenv __venv__
source __venv__/bin/activate
pip install mkdocs
mkdocs build
```

# Public API

MeasurementKit is composed of several libraries. Follow the links below
to find out more on a specific library API.

- [common](api/common.md): common functionality
- [dns](api/dns.md): dns library
- [ext](api/ext.nd): third party headers
- [http](api/http.md): http library
- [mlabns](api/mlabns.md): m-lab name service library
- [ndt](api/ndt.md): network diagnostic tool library
- [net](api/net.md): low-level networking library
- [nettests](api/nettests.md): drive running network tests
- [ooni](api/ooni.md): open observatory of network interference library
- [portable](api/portable.md): portable C library headers
- [report](api/report.md): library for managing test results
- [traceroute](api/traceroute.md): traceroute library

If you're new to MeasurementKit and all you want is to use it to run
network tests, start from [nettests](api/nettests.md).

Each library is contained in its own header file named after the module and
stored inside the `measurement_kit` directory in the include path.

Therefore, to pull `dns` module's definitions, write:

```C++
#include <measurement_kit/dns.hpp>
```

All MeasurementKit code is contained in the `mk` namespace. There are
child namespaces for each module except `common`. In fact, definitions
contained in `common.hpp` are so common that they live in the `mk`
namespace alone to save the user a few types. For example, to use the
`Error` class of the `common` module, type:

```C++
#include <measurement_kit/common.hpp>

// ...

mk::Error error;
```

(In general, you don't need to include `common.hpp` directly, because any
other Measurement Kit header includes `common.hpp`.)

For all other submodules, the definitions live inside a sub-namespace
named after the module. So, for example, to access class `Buffer` in
the `net` module, you need to type:

```C++
#include <measurement_kit/net.hpp>

// ...

mk::net::Buffer buffer;
```

Of course, to write less in C++ files, you can use a `using namespace`
declaration to pull everything from the `mk` namespace. For example:

```C++
#include <measurement_kit/net.hpp>

using namespace mk;

// ...

Error error;
net::Buffer buffer;
```

The above example also shows that `Error` (and other `common.hpp` definitions)
are automatically pulled by `net.hpp`.
